#### Openstack 4j Trove
OpenStack Trove is a DBaaS (Database as a service) solution. It offers IT organizations the ability to operate a complete DBaaS platform within the enterprise. IT organizations can offer a rich variety of databases to their internal customers with the same ease of use that Amazon offers with its AWS cloud and the RDS product. 
Openstack trove supports both RDBMS as well as NoSQL databases.

#### Our Contributions
As openstack4j was the most widely used library amongst the developer community it was a good idea to have the support for Trove as well. 
With its simplistic fluent API and intelligent error handling the experience of interacting Openstack has been made its easy.[More info]( https://www.gslab.com/fluent-api-client-for-openstack-trove/)
