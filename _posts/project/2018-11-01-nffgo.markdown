#### NFF-Go: Network Function Framework for GO (former YANFF)
NFF-Go is a set of libraries for creating and deploying cloud-native Network Functions (NFs).
It simplifies the creation of network functions without sacrificing performance.
NFF-Go is part of DPDK project umbrella under Linux Foundation

#### Our Contributions
Developed Fixed BNG-PGW Data Plane (DP) Virtual Network Function (VNF )
 which supports the following PGW Data Path(DP) features:

    1.PCC (Policy Control and Charging) rules configuration.
    2.ADC (Application Detection and control) rules configuration.
    3.Packet Filters for Service Data Flow (SDF) configuration.
    4.Packet Selectors/Filters for ADC configuration.
    5.UE sessions with multiple Bearer support.
    6.KNI with static ARP and dynamic arp support
    7.Using Netlink for route and arp cache discovery and lookup.
    8.CP (Control Path) Simulator for establishing UE session.

  Development is under "Fixed_BNG" branch.
