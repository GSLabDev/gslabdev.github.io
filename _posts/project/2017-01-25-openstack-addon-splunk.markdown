#### Openstack App and Addon for Splunk
The Openstack cloud  has a lot of services and the status of the services keeps on changing. It becomes challenging for admin or any 
person to monitor all the services at a time. The horizon (dashboard) of Openstack does not present clear picture about why a service 
has stopped working. The admin needs to log in the system to check the log files and try to find the cause of the problem. All of this is time consuming and not a good solution. 

We felt the need for a monitoring tool for Openstack using splunk. Splunk has capability to search any type of data as long as it can 
be represented in text format. Searches are made using the Search Processing Language (SPL). The search processing language is also fast 
enough to even give real time status of the services . So we developed Openstack App for Splunk and Openstack Addon for Splunk
